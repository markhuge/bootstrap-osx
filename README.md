WIP - Bootstrap scripts/files for a new OS X install

# Abstract
I use this for bootstrapping new (personal) OS X installs. Currently on El Capitan

This is a **descriptive** repo and not a **prescriptive** one.

Ideas/suggestions are welcome, but this is basically a step above dotfiles.

# Testing
`./test.sh`
